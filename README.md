# Gismo

This is a very WIP and incomplete web app framework somewhat inspired by [go-app](https://github.com/maxence-charriere/go-app) and recently revived after I found out about [Gooroo](https://github.com/Matbabs/Gooroo)
through [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/17c6c3h/dare_to_imagine_web_development_without_js_what/).

Eventually, the goal of Gismo is to have a complete framework (including a [JSX](https://react.dev/learn/writing-markup-with-jsx) pre-processor), enabling the development of
web apps and/or components utilizing nothing but Go, Gismo and a set of dedidcated CLI
tools that mimic node/npm/bun/deno.
